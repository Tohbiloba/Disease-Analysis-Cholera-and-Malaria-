1. The countries should device workable methods to reduce the outbreak of these disease in their country.
2. The countries can adopt a public sensitization from time to time to lecture the citizenry on how to prevent the outbreak of these diseases.
3. The government should provide free check up and treatment for citizens with these diseases.
